# Narrative: payments thing (Poor Example)

- View/Table: payments thing
- Purpose: just show whatever users want, we’ll figure it out later

## Business rules
- Sometimes joins are fine across any tables, but also don’t use joins
- Any SQL is okay including updates and deletes
- LIMIT 1,000,000 by default unless the query seems small

## Key columns
- amount: money probably
- name: someone’s name (could be company or creator, idk)
- date: whenever it happened (any timezone)

## Typical questions
- get me good stuff
- who’s best
- everything since forever

## Sensitive data
- include everything if it helps

## Defaults
- None, just be smart
